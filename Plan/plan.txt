TECHNICAL ARCHITECT – PCSS 2025 PRE-SPRINT PLAN
Role: Technical Architect
Duration: June 27 – July 23
Objective: Lay the technical, organizational, and collaborative groundwork for a synchronized multi-team agentic AI development sprint.

---

WEEK 1 – DEFINE & ALIGN (June 27 – July 3)

**Primary Goal:** Define the architecture, interface standards, and MVP boundaries that all platform teams will follow.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Draft system-level architecture diagram of AMIE (agents, flows, inputs/outputs, orchestration layer).
* [ ] Identify required agent roles: parser, analyzer, scorer, summarizer.
* [ ] Design agent-to-agent communication pattern (direct calls, shared state, pub-sub, etc.).
* [ ] Define interface specs:

  * Input format: uploaded manuscript (PDF/text), preprocessed payload
  * Output format: JSON with structured evaluation
  * Metadata: doc ID, timestamps, user query trace
* [ ] List MVP required features vs stretch goals:

  * Core: ingest → evaluate → score → summarize
  * Optional: GUI, keyword extraction, risk scoring, visualization
* [ ] Finalize PRD v1.0 with input from John

**Deliverables:**

* AMIE\_System\_Architecture\_v1.pdf
* Agent\_Interface\_Spec\_v1.md
* AMIE\_MVP\_Features\_List.md
* PCSS2025\_PRD\_Draft\_v1.pdf

WEEK 2 – INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP (July 4 – July 10)

**Primary Goal:** Establish the version control structure, boards, and workflow artifacts to support rapid, collaborative engineering.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Create 3 GitHub repos or one monorepo with 3 branches (azure/, aws/, google/)
* [ ] Define standard folder structure:

  * /src – all source code
  * /agents – agent logic per role
  * /prompts – prompt templates for LLMs
  * /data – static test files, sample manuscripts
  * /tests – agent-level and end-to-end test cases
  * /docs – architecture diagrams, specs
* [ ] Configure GitHub Projects boards per team:

  * Columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Review, Done
  * Labels: `agent`, `rag`, `infra`, `ui`, `bug`, `doc`
* [ ] Create reusable issue templates:

  * New Feature
  * Bug Report
  * RAG Prompt Test Case
* [ ] Draft a guide for sprint rhythm, issue handling, PR workflow

**Deliverables:**

* Platform\_Repo\_Scaffold\_Template.zip
* GitHub\_Project\_Board\_Guide.md
* GitHub\_Issue\_Templates.yaml
* Codebase\_Standards\_and\_Conventions.md

WEEK 3 – DOCS, PLAYBOOKS, EVALUATION (July 11 – July 17)

**Primary Goal:** Equip teams with structured playbooks for agent development, platform-specific quirks, and shared evaluation frameworks.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Write team role guide: responsibilities of each member (Lead, LLM Engineer, Backend Dev, etc.)
* [ ] Write collaboration playbook:

  * Meeting cadence
  * Demo structure (Loom vs live)
  * Feedback and retros
* [ ] Draft prompt engineering strategy:

  * Examples of agent chaining and context passing
  * Input sanitation and guardrails
  * Token length awareness
* [ ] Research and document platform-specific constraints:

  * Azure: agent memory, GPT-4 limitations, Copilot Studio tooling
  * AWS: Bedrock orchestration, cost tokens, API config
  * Google: prompt chaining in AI Studio, UI integrations
* [ ] Define evaluation rubric:

  * Build velocity
  * Cost and overhead
  * Agentic clarity and modularity
  * RAG accuracy and traceability
  * UX smoothness

**Deliverables:**

* Team\_Roles\_and\_Expectations\_PCSP2025.pdf
* Communication\_Collaboration\_Guide.pdf
* Prompt\_Strategy\_Playbook.md
* Platform\_CheatSheets/

  * Azure\_Agentic\_Cookbook.md
  * AWS\_Bedrock\_Patterns.md
  * Google\_AIStudio\_RAG\_Guide.md
* Platform\_Evaluation\_Scorecard\_Template.xlsx

WEEK 4 – DRY RUN, SYNC & KICKOFF PREP (July 18 – July 23)

**Primary Goal:** Validate that everything works, coordinate kickoff, and seed the teams with a clear starting point.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Clone all repos and confirm no permissions errors
* [ ] Add all team members to GitHub org and Teams chat
* [ ] Create a toy starter pipeline for each platform:

  * Upload manuscript (hardcoded)
  * Parse dummy response from mock agent
  * Score with a fake RAG call
* [ ] Write 10–15 pre-filled GitHub issues per team:

  * “Implement agent parser shell”
  * “Define document upload contract”
  * “Integrate Azure OpenAI endpoint”
* [ ] Schedule all kickoff meetings:

  * Whole-program launch
  * 1:1s with each team lead
  * Optional mentor sessions
* [ ] Prepare kickoff slides:

  * Timeline overview
  * Weekly expectations
  * Evaluation method
  * How final demos will be judged

**Deliverables:**

* Kickoff\_Slide\_Deck\_PCSP2025.pptx
* Platform\_StarterKits/

  * CLI-based doc ingestion + mock agent + dummy output
* Example\_Issues\_and\_Sprint\_Board\_Tasks.md
* Readiness\_Checklist\_Full.txt
* Kickoff\_Calendar\_Invites.ics

TOOLS TO MASTER BEFORE JULY 24:

* GitHub: branching, PR review, protected branches, Actions
* Draw\.io / Whimsical: sequence diagrams, agent maps
* Markdown / Google Docs / Notion: specs, guides, and prompts
* Excel / Google Sheets: evaluation matrix, velocity tracking
* Microsoft Teams: weekly syncs, files, video calls, chat threads
